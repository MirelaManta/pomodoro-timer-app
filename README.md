### Pomodoro Timer App ###
__This is a very useful tool that increases your productivity levels by making you aware of the time you devote to a task without distractions.__

The steps that make this technique so effective are as it follows:
* you pick a task that you want to work on or need to complete
* start the timer (the work time is set to 25 mins) and try to not have any distractions
* when time's up, a âœ” will be added on the screen and you'll be in you first short break (5 min)
  * after the 4th round of work, you will have a longer break (30 minutes)
* and pretty much, that's it

___The GUI was created usig tkinter package.___
